Introduction to Data Analytics Course which was done in Sem 2, 2018

The project was worth 40% of the final grade and was meant to be a team project.

However with the past experiences in the field of data science, I realised I had significant expertise in this field and decided to conduct:
- Data exploration
- Data analysis
- Data modelling
On my own and push my limits as solo individual project.

My research is about using Kickstarter data to predict which projects will achieve funding as well as those which do not seem likely to with Machine learning. But before that, there is data exploration and data analysis to understand the Kickstarter data.

This project is the result of my work and I hope it proves to be useful to you.

Please be careful not to plagarize as University of Sydney is very strict in its policies.
